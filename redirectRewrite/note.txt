1. create location block /crops
2. use return [http code] /fruits
3. we use code 307 = 307 Temporary Redirect redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location headers.

Rewrite

2. rewrite ^/number/(\w+) /count/$1 ,\w+=what ever, $1 = variable store \w+1
3. if we request localhost:8080/number/999 nginx will serve localhost:8080/count/999
    \w+ = 999 and $1=999
